This Book Will Show You How<br /><br />The weight loss and diet industry pulls in more than 40 billion dollars annually in the United States alone. Despite this massive amount of money people just seem to keep packing on the pounds. Why is this? The truth of the matter is that the diet industry is largely a fraudulent empire based on false assumptions that it largely perpetuates. Which of the following statements do you believe?<br /><br />My problem is that I need to lose 20 pounds<br />There is no substitute for will power if you want to lose weight<br />All successful programs for healthy and natural weight loss require a special eating plan made up of low calorie meals<br />Three pounds a week is about the minimum amount of weight that you should expect to lose on a healthy diet plan<br />The fact of the matter is that it would take me about 50 push-ups, 100 deep knee bends and 200 sit ups combined with running around the block to burn off the calories from one piece of pie.

A brilliant young boy, Andrew \"Ender\" Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't make the cut—young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training.<br /><br />Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister. <br /><br />Is Ender the general Earth needs? But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway for almost as long. Ender's two older siblings are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. Between the three of them lie the abilities to remake a world. If, that is, the world survives.&#xa0;<i>Ender's Game</i> is the winner of the 1985 Nebula Award for Best Novel and the 1986 Hugo Award for Best Novel.<br /><br />At the publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management software (DRM) applied.","trackId":378317492,"releaseDate":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","artworkUrl60":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Publication125/v4/f2/d6/b0/f2d6b049-6f6f-e1a7-b595-c9c854af1598/9781429963930.jpg/60x60bb.jpg","artworkUrl100":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Publication125/v4/f2/d6/b0/f2d6b049-6f6f-e1a7-b595-c9c854af1598/9781429963930.jpg/100x100bb.jpg","artistViewUrl":"https://books.apple.com/us/artist/orson-scott-card/3424725?uo=4","trackName":"Ender's Game","genreIds":["10063","38","9020"],"artistIds":[3424725],"kind":"ebook","averageUserRating":4.5,"userRatingCount":7027},{"currency":"USD","trackViewUrl":"https://books.apple.com/us/book/digger-the-dinosaur/id444098179?uo=4","trackCensoredName":"Digger the Dinosaur","fileSizeBytes":18920820,"formattedPrice":"$4.99","artistId":687535775,"artistName":"Rebecca Dotlich","genres":["Early Readers","Books","Kids","Learning to Read","Fiction","Animals","Science & Nature","Humor"],"price":4.99,"description":"Digger the Dinosaur&#xa0;may be huge, but he has the heart of a preschooler.
