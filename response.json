These releases offer the best ever sound and picture quality on a Queen concert release.  Always a great live band, with two years non-stop touring behind them and Freddie Mercury in front of them, Queen excelled themselves with the cameras rolling. The footage has been digitally restored from the original film and the sound has been newly mixed and mastered for DTS Surround Sound and PCM Stereo from the original multi-track tapes.“Hello Montreal...long time no see. You wanna get crazy?” asks Freddie as the band tear into their alternative ‘fast’ version of We Will Rock You, and from there on Queen show their hard rock roots, slowing down only for Love of My Life and the more mid-tempo Under Pressure, notably being performed live for the first time in this concert. The real joy to be had in watching Freddie, Brian, Roger and John performing here is that, unlike any other Queen concert film available, this delivers raw Queen. This is before the Hot Space album, before keyboards would find a place in the band’s touring line up; this is simply four musicians in total cohesion. Originally titled, “We Will Rock You”, this film was first launched at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1983 - as only Queen could. It was then released in North America (September 1984), becoming the first commercially available film of Queen in concert.  For this special edition, the picture has been digitally restored from the original 35mm negative."},{"wrapperType":"track","kind":"feature-movie","trackId":1628948609,"artistName":"Todd Haynes","trackName":"Velvet Goldmine","trackCensoredName":"Velvet Goldmine","trackViewUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/velvet-goldmine/id1628948609?uo=4","previewUrl":"https://video-ssl.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/Video112/v4/d8/ea/bf/d8eabfb6-c0c7-e893-377d-b5fd7c3b54e8/mzvf_1044870215611505974.640x480.h264lc.U.p.m4v","artworkUrl30":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video112/v4/f0/5b/0c/f05b0c48-9ee4-311a-a4ae-a5dbe7d82f1a/SPE_VELVET_GOLDMINE_WW_ARTWORK_EN_2000x3000_3BV4UL000000XQ.lsr/30x30bb.jpg","artworkUrl60":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video112/v4/f0/5b/0c/f05b0c48-9ee4-311a-a4ae-a5dbe7d82f1a/SPE_VELVET_GOLDMINE_WW_ARTWORK_EN_2000x3000_3BV4UL000000XQ.lsr/60x60bb.jpg","artworkUrl100":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video112/v4/f0/5b/0c/f05b0c48-9ee4-311a-a4ae-a5dbe7d82f1a/SPE_VELVET_GOLDMINE_WW_ARTWORK_EN_2000x3000_3BV4UL000000XQ.lsr/100x100bb.jpg","collectionPrice":12.99,"trackPrice":12.99,"trackRentalPrice":3.99,"collectionHdPrice":12.99,"trackHdPrice":12.99,"trackHdRentalPrice":3.99,"releaseDate":"1998-01-01T08:00:00Z","collectionExplicitness":"notExplicit","trackExplicitness":"notExplicit","trackTimeMillis":7151583,"country":"USA","currency":"USD","primaryGenreName":"Drama","contentAdvisoryRating":"R","shortDescription":"Starring Ewan McGregor (Star Wars: Episode I, Trainspotting) and Jonathan Rhys Meyers (The Governess","longDescription":"Starring Ewan McGregor (Star Wars: Episode I, Trainspotting) and Jonathan Rhys Meyers (The Governess, Michael Collins) – executive producer Michael Stipe of R.E.M. presents this electrifying journey though rock ‘n' roll's most outrageous era!

A once storied seaside resort, Asbury Park erupted in flames during a summer of civil unrest, crippling the town for the next 45 years and reducing it to a state of urban blight. A town literally divided by a set of railroad tracks, the riot destroyed the fabled Westside jazz and blues scene, but from the flames of the burning city emerged the iconic Jersey sound. Asbury Park returns Asbury sons Steven Van Zandt, Southside Johnny Lyon and Bruce Springsteen to the legendary Upstage, the psychedelic after hours club where they got their start, featuring never before seen interviews and performances. Shuttered for four and a half decades, the Upstage remains a perfect time capsule of the Club, which united both sides of the tracks in Asbury and acted as a crucible for young talent. Now, as Asbury Park enjoys its long awaited renaissance, it is music, which has brought it back from the dead. The film is supported in association with Jersey Mike’s, which allows all profits worldwide to be dedicated to promoting and creating music education programs for wide distribution."},{"wrapperType":"track","kind":"feature-movie","artistId":1420559,"trackId":578851709,"artistName":"O.A.R.","trackName":"O.A.R.: Live on Red Rocks","trackCensoredName":"O.A.R.: Live on Red Rocks","artistViewUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/o-a-r/1420559?uo=4","trackViewUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/o-a-r-live-on-red-rocks/id578851709?uo=4","previewUrl":"https://video-ssl.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/Video117/v4/6b/c8/f6/6bc8f605-a752-6f73-0933-abc85cafa015/mzvf_5871457809120676401.640x478.h264lc.U.p.m4v","artworkUrl30":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video/v4/55/df/70/55df70e5-d4d8-fb05-1553-a963c3b1e66f/OAR_LiveOnRedRocks_1400x2100.jpg/30x30bb.jpg","artworkUrl60":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video/v4/55/df/70/55df70e5-d4d8-fb05-1553-a963c3b1e66f/OAR_LiveOnRedRocks_1400x2100.jpg/60x60bb.jpg","artworkUrl100":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video/v4/55/df/70/55df70e5-d4d8-fb05-1553-a963c3b1e66f/OAR_LiveOnRedRocks_1400x2100.jpg/100x100bb.jpg","collectionPrice":14.99,"trackPrice":14.99,"trackRentalPrice":3.99,"collectionHdPrice":19.99,"trackHdPrice":19.99,"trackHdRentalPrice":4.99,"releaseDate":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","collectionExplicitness":"notExplicit","trackExplicitness":"notExplicit","trackTimeMillis":11087453,"country":"USA","currency":"USD","primaryGenreName":"Concert Films","contentAdvisoryRating":"NR","shortDescription":"Filmed and recorded live at the iconic Red Rocks Amphitheater on July 15, 2012, Live on Red Rocks","longDescription":"Filmed and recorded live at the iconic Red Rocks Amphitheater on July 15, 2012, Live on Red Rocks captures O.A.R. in their element - performing an inspired and energetic show to a packed house in the middle of summer.
